### A WebGL Youtube Visualizer  
![TreePer Demo](https://media.giphy.com/media/PyMlMbza22tqM/giphy.gif)  
This is a little, quick and dirty project.  
I've integrated the work of [Yannis Gravezas](http://github.com/wizgrav/clubber) inside YouTube using a Chrome extension to avoid CORS and TOS violations.

### Controls

| Button | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `[` or `-` | Decrease video opacity |
| `]` or `+` | Increase video opacity |
| `b` | Previous shader |
| `n` | Next shader |


### Sharing

TreePer comes with the possibility to share the visualization with your friends by sharing the youtube url in the location bar. Same shader and opacity will be applied.

### Shaders  
I would like to add some other shaders.  
Feel free to fork and add/edit. Don't forget to send a PR.

This is probably the dirtiest code you'll read today, but it works, maybe.
